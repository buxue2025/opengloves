cd opengloves

# Copy example config and edit it
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your gateway token

# Start the server (HTTP mode)
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser!

### 🔐 Access Setup
1. Enter the access password: `changeme123` (default)
2. Click **Connect** to access your OpenClaw gateway
3. Start chatting or use slash commands like `/help`

## 📝 Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize your setup:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "http": {
      "enabled": true,
      "port": 8080
    },
    "https": {
      "enabled": false,
      "port": 8443,
      "autoGenerateCert": true
    }
  },
  "gateway": {
    "url": "ws://localhost:18789",
    "token": "your-gateway-token-here",
    "autoDetectUrl": true
  },
  "ui": {
    "title": "OpenGloves",
    "sessionKey": "main",
    "accessPassword": "changeme123"
  }
}
```

### Getting Your Gateway Token

Your OpenClaw gateway token can be found in:
```bash
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Look for `gateway.auth.token`.

## ⚡ Using Slash Commands

OpenGloves supports convenient slash commands:

- `/help` - Show all available commands
- `/clear` - Clear chat history  
- `/status` - Show connection status and statistics
- `/export [format]` - Export chat (json/md/txt)
- `/theme [mode]` - Switch theme (dark/light/auto)
- `/reconnect` - Reconnect to gateway

Example: Type `/export md` to download your chat as Markdown.

## 📱 Mobile & PWA Usage

### Mobile Interface
- On mobile devices, OpenGloves shows a compact interface
- Password and connection controls are grouped for easy access
- Touch-optimized buttons and spacing

### Install as App (PWA)
1. Open OpenGloves in a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
2. Look for "📱 Install as App" button at the bottom
3. Click to install as a native app on your device
4. Access from your home screen/app drawer

### Mobile Tips
- Swipe gestures work for navigation
- File upload via camera or gallery
- Offline capability when installed as PWA

## 🔐 HTTPS Setup

### Automatic (Recommended)

Enable HTTPS in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "https": {
      "enabled": true,
      "autoGenerateCert": true
    }
  }
}
```

Then start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

A self-signed certificate will be automatically generated in `./certs/`.

### First Access

When accessing via HTTPS, your browser will show a security warning. This is normal for self-signed certificates!

1. Click **"Advanced"** or **"Show Details"**
2. Click **"Continue"** or **"Accept Risk"**
3. (Optional) Import the certificate to avoid future warnings

## 🌐 LAN Access

Access from another device on your local network is automatic! Just visit your server's IP address.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Gateway Connection Failed

1. Check gateway is running: `openclaw gateway status`
2. Verify token in `config.json` matches `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
3. Ensure gateway `bind` is set to `"lan"` (not `"loopback"`)

### HTTPS Certificate Error

- Browser shows warning → This is normal, click "Continue"
- Certificate generation failed → Ensure OpenSSL is installed

### Can't Access from Other Devices

1. Check firewall allows ports 8080/8443
2. Verify `server.host` is `"0.0.0.0"` (not `"localhost"`)
3. Check gateway `allowedOrigins` includes your server IP
